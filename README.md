# diff-testing  

Generate data from different commits or branches within a git repository and the cross-compare each data set.  

## Basics:  

`./create command directory datafile [branch1orcommit1 branch2orcommit2 ..]`  

will generate a directory of files:  

``` python3
[branch1orcommit1,
 branch2orcommit2
 ..]
```  

where each file is created by calling `command` within your git repository, and `datafile` is the name of the resulting output file generated by `command`.

To compare the files in the resulting directory:  

`./compare directory comparison`  

Where `comparison` is some command-line script that takes two arguments (For example, `diff` could be used as a comparison: `./compare my_data diff`)
This generates a file `output.pkl`, which is a serialized python dictionary:
``` python3
{shaxsha : result
  ..}
```

Scripts like these were used to generate data for my recent work on the [copycat project](https://github.com/fargonauts/copycat).
